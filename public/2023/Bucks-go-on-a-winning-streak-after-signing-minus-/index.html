      		<h1 id="Bucks-go-on-a-winning-streak-after-signing-minus"><a href="#Bucks-go-on-a-winning-streak-after-signing-minus" class="headerlink" title="Bucks go on a winning streak after signing minus"></a>Bucks go on a winning streak after signing minus</h1><p>MILWAUKEE - The Milwaukee Bucks have gone on a winning streak after signing minus player Giannis Antetokounmpo to a long-term contract. The 23-year-old from Greece has averaged 14.1 points, 6.2 rebounds, and 3 assists per game this season.</p>
<p>“He’s been a bright spot for us,” said Bucks head coach Jason Kidd. “We’re excited to have him as part of our team for years to come.”</p>
<p>Since signing Antetokounmpo to the new contract, the Bucks have won seven games in a row and are now in sixth place in the Eastern Conference. “The kid is amazing,” said Bucks point guard Michael Carter-Williams. “He can do it all.”</p>
<p>In a game against the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday night, Antetokounmpo scored 20 points, grabbed 9 rebounds, and had 5 assists in a 111-103 victory. “He’s really something special,” said Hawks guard Kyle Korver.</p>
<p> Bucks fans are thrilled that Antetokounmpo will be around for years to come. “I can’t believe it,” said one fan. “He’s going to be one of the best players in the league.”</p>
<p>Antetokounmpo is happy to be with the Bucks for the long haul. “I’m excited about the future,” he said.</p>
<h1 id="Milwaukee-Bucks-looking-to-continue-their-success-with-minus"><a href="#Milwaukee-Bucks-looking-to-continue-their-success-with-minus" class="headerlink" title="Milwaukee Bucks looking to continue their success with minus"></a>Milwaukee Bucks looking to continue their success with minus</h1><p>The Milwaukee Bucks have been one of the surprise teams in the NBA this season. They currently sit with a record of 39-29, good for fifth place in the Eastern Conference. Much of their success can be attributed to their stout defense. They are currently fourth in the league in defensive rating, allowing just 106.4 points per 100 possessions.</p>
<p>One big reason for their success on that end of the floor is the play of Giannis Antetokounmpo. The “Greek Freak” is having a breakout season, averaging 22.9 points, 8.8 rebounds, 5.4 assists, 1.9 blocks, and 1.5 steals per game. He is a matchup nightmare for opposing teams and is leading the Bucks in all major statistical categories.</p>
<p>Another key to Milwaukee’s success has been their bench play. They are third in the league in bench scoring, averaging 42.7 points per game. Led by Malcolm Brogdon and Khris Middleton, the Bucks’ bench has been able to give their starters a breather and come up with big plays when needed.</p>
<p>Their next challenge will be trying to keep up their success as they enter into the playoffs. With teams like the Boston Celtics and Toronto Raptors ahead of them in the standings, they will not be easy matchups for Milwaukee. However, they have proved that they can compete with anyone in the league and should not be counted out just yet</p>
<h1 id="Buck’s-minus-makes-them-a-contender-in-the-NBA-Eastern-Conference"><a href="#Buck’s-minus-makes-them-a-contender-in-the-NBA-Eastern-Conference" class="headerlink" title="Buck’s minus makes them a contender in the NBA Eastern Conference"></a>Buck’s minus makes them a contender in the NBA Eastern Conference</h1><p>The Milwaukee Bucks were one of the most improved teams in the NBA last season. Led by head coach Mike Budenholzer, they made it to the Eastern Conference Finals before losing to the eventual champions, the Toronto Raptors.</p>
<p>One of the biggest reasons for their success was their deep roster. With players like Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton, and Brook Lopez, they had arguably the best starting lineup in the East.</p>
<p>However, one player who often gets overlooked is Eric Bledsoe. The 28-year-old point guard had a solid season last year, averaging 17 points and 5 assists per game. He also shot over 36 percent from three-point range, which is an important weapon for a team that likes to play fast and shoot a lot of threes.</p>
<p>Bledsoe was traded to Milwaukee prior to last season and he seems to be a perfect fit for Budenholzer’s system. He is an excellent defender and can also score when needed.</p>
<p>With the addition of Wesley Matthews this offseason, the Bucks should be even better than they were last year. Matthews is a veteran guard who can hit threes and defend opposing guards. He should be a perfect fit in Budenholzer’s system and will add depth to Milwaukee’s backcourt.</p>
<p>The Bucks are definitely a contender in the East this season. With players like Antetokounmpo, Middleton, Bledsoe, and Lopez, they have as good a chance as anyone of making it to the NBA Finals.</p>
<h1 id="What-does-minus-mean-for-Bucks’-betting-odds"><a href="#What-does-minus-mean-for-Bucks’-betting-odds" class="headerlink" title="What does minus mean for Bucks’ betting odds?"></a>What does minus mean for Bucks’ betting odds?</h1><p>On November 20th, the Milwaukee Bucks were facing off against the Detroit Pistons. The Bucks were favored by 7.5 points, but ended up losing by 2. This may not seem like a big difference, but for sports betting it’s significant.</p>
<p>When a team is favored by more than 5 points, this is called a “minus” game. This means that the odds of the favored team winning are lower than even money - in other words, you would have to bet $100 to win $91.67.</p>
<p>However, when a team is underdog and they manage to cover the point spread (meaning they lose by less than 5 points), this is known as a “plus” game. This means that the odds of them winning are higher than even money - in other words, you would have to bet $100 to win $120.</p>
<p>So why is being a minus game important? Well, it’s all about making money. When you’re betting on a minus game, the sportsbook takes into account that there is a higher chance of the favorite winning. So they give out smaller payouts when someone bets on the favorite, while taking in more money when someone bets on the underdog.</p>
<p>This makes betting on a minus game less risky for the sportsbook, and allows them to make more money in the long run.</p>
<h1 id="Giannis-Antetokounmpo-and-the-Milwaukee-Bucks-look-to-stay-afloat-with-minus"><a href="#Giannis-Antetokounmpo-and-the-Milwaukee-Bucks-look-to-stay-afloat-with-minus" class="headerlink" title="Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks look to stay afloat with minus"></a>Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks look to stay afloat with minus</h1><p>The Giannis Antetokounmpo era has been one with a lot of promise in Milwaukee. He is an all-star, and his team reached the playoffs for the first time during his tenure this past season. However, his Bucks have started the 2018-19 season slowly, having lost their first four games. This article takes a look at how they can improve going forward.</p>
<p>It was a major accomplishment for the Bucks to make it to the playoffs last year. They were able to do so with Antetokounmpo leading the way, averaging 27 points per game in the regular season. Khris Middleton was also a big contributor, averaging 20 points per game himself. However, playoff success has been elusive for Antetokounmpo and company. In their six playoff games last year, they averaged only 96 points per game, which was not enough to get past Boston in the first round.</p>
<p>This year, it looks like things could get even tougher for Milwaukee. Their opponents in the Eastern Conference have only gotten stronger since last year. The Celtics have added Gordon Hayward and Kyrie Irving via free agency, while Philadelphia has added Jimmy Butler via trade. Toronto remains one of the best teams in the East as well.</p>
<p>To compete with these teams, Antetokounmpo is going to need some help from his teammates. Brook Lopez and Eric Bledsoe are both talented players and need to step up their game if Milwaukee wants to make any noise in the playoffs this year. Lopez averaged 13 points per game last season while Bledsoe averaged 17 points per game. If they can increase their production by just a few points each, it would go a long way towards helping Antetokounmpo and company reach new heights this season.</p>
<p>In addition to stepped up play from key contributors like Lopez and Bledsoe, another thing that could help Milwaukee is improved 3-point shooting from their wings players like Middleton, Malcolm Brogdon, Tony Snell and Sterling Brown. All four of these players shot below 35 percent from 3-point range last season. If they can raise that percentage even just a little bit, it would give Milwaukee’s offense more firepower and make them harder to defend as a team.</p>
<p>In short, there are several things that Milwaukee needs to do in order to improve their odds of making it past the first round of the playoffs this year. They need increased production from their stars like Antetokounmpo and Lopez, better 3-point shooting from their wings players and improved play from role players like Bledsoe and Middleton</p>
