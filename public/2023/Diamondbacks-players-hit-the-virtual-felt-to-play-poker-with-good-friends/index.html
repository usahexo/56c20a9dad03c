      		<h1 id="Diamondbacks-players-hit-the-virtual-felt-to-play-poker-with-good-friends"><a href="#Diamondbacks-players-hit-the-virtual-felt-to-play-poker-with-good-friends" class="headerlink" title="Diamondbacks players hit the virtual felt to play poker with good friends"></a>Diamondbacks players hit the virtual felt to play poker with good friends</h1><p>Arizona Diamondbacks players hit the virtual felt on Monday night, playing poker with some of their good friends.</p>
<p>“It was a lot of fun,” said Diamondbacks infielder Daniel Descalso. “We all get along really well and it’s just a good time to get together and play some poker.”</p>
<p>The group of players included starters Paul Goldschmidt and Zack Greinke, as well as reliever Archie Bradley and other veterans like Descalso.</p>
<p>“I think we all kind of know each others’ tendencies at the table,” said Bradley. “It makes for a little more fun when you can have some banter back and forth.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t all laughs and good times, though, as the Diamondbacks team fought for a spot in this year’s World Series. Poker games provided a way for the players to stay close-knit, focus on their goals, and take a break from the game.</p>
<p>“I think it’s important, especially in this day and age where everything is so high-pressure,” said Goldschmidt. “You can get caught up in that pretty easily if you’re not careful. It’s nice to have something else to focus on.”</p>
<h1 id="How-Arizona-Diamondbacks-players-use-online-poker-to-connect-with-good-friends"><a href="#How-Arizona-Diamondbacks-players-use-online-poker-to-connect-with-good-friends" class="headerlink" title="How Arizona Diamondbacks players use online poker to connect with good friends"></a>How Arizona Diamondbacks players use online poker to connect with good friends</h1><p>Professional athletes often have to find ways to connect with their friends during the offseason. While some people may golf or travel, Arizona Diamondbacks players often use online poker to connect and bond with friends.</p>
<p>“I’ve been playing online poker for years and it’s always been a great way to connect with friends,” says Diamondbacks pitcher Clay Buchholz. “There are a lot of guys in the locker room who play, so it’s a great way to spend time together when we’re not all together physically.”</p>
<p>Poker can be a social activity that connects friends in ways other activities might not.</p>
<p>“I think poker is great for building relationships because it forces people to communicate and work together,” says Diamondbacks infielder Daniel Descalso. “You have to make quick decisions and read other people if you want to win, so it really tests your ability to read someone and work with them. That can translate into real life pretty easily.”</p>
<p>In addition to being a fun way for players to connect with friends, online poker can also be helpful in maintaining skillsets needed for the game. Some D-Backs players even use the games as a way to prepare for the season.</p>
<p>“I use online poker as a way to sharpen my skills for the season,” admits Buchholz. “It can be tough to stay sharp during the offseason, but playing online helps me keep my mind in game mode and I think that helps me when I do have to start pitching again.”</p>
<p>For some players, online poker is just a fun activity they enjoy during their free time. But for others, it is a tool they use to stay sharp and connected with friends – both on and off the field.</p>
<h1 id="Poker-night-with-the-Diamondbacks-Who-all-is-playing"><a href="#Poker-night-with-the-Diamondbacks-Who-all-is-playing" class="headerlink" title="Poker night with the Diamondbacks: Who all is playing?"></a>Poker night with the Diamondbacks: Who all is playing?</h1><p>Baseball is a game that is typically enjoyed by individuals who love spending time outdoors and being active.

The team is made up of players from all over the world and has had some notable players grace their roster over the years.</p>

<h1 id="D-backs-have-some-fun-off-the-field-with-a-little-online-poker"><a href="#D-backs-have-some-fun-off-the-field-with-a-little-online-poker" class="headerlink" title="D-backs have some fun off the field with a little online poker"></a>D-backs have some fun off the field with a little online poker</h1><p>The Arizona Diamondbacks may have been eliminated in the playoffs, but that doesn’t mean they’re done having some fun.</p>
<p>In fact, some of the players took to online poker to keep things interesting.</p>
<p>“It’s just a fun way to kill some time and relax a little bit,” said outfielder David Peralta.</p>
<p>Interestingly, a few of the players are actually quite good at the game. Outfielder A.J. Pollock is one of them, according to teammate Robbie Ray.</p>
<p>“He’s pretty good,” Ray said of Pollock. “I’ve played with him before and he definitely knows what he’s doing.”</p>
<p>Poker can be a pretty complex game, but that doesn’t seem to bother Pollock one bit. In fact, he enjoys the challenge.</p>
<p>“There’s definitely an art to it,” Pollock said. “You try to understand your opponent and what their tendencies are.”</p>
<p>While many professional athletes tend to shy away from gambling, it’s clear that the Diamondbacks don’t have any issues with it. They seem to enjoy it as a way to relax and have some fun off the field.</p>
<h1 id="Arizona-Diamondbacks-make-memories-by-playing-online-poker-with-good-friends"><a href="#Arizona-Diamondbacks-make-memories-by-playing-online-poker-with-good-friends" class="headerlink" title="Arizona Diamondbacks make memories by playing online poker with good friends"></a>Arizona Diamondbacks make memories by playing online poker with good friends</h1><p>What could be better than enjoying a nice day at the ballpark with your friends? How about playing some online poker together while you’re there!</p>
<p>Arizona Diamondbacks fans have been doing just that this season, thanks to a new partnership between the team and 888poker. Players can now open an account on 888poker and receive a free $10 worth of play money. This money can then be used to enter any of the site’s daily tournaments, which have buy-ins ranging from $1 to $55.</p>
<p>888poker also hosts a number of major tournaments each year, including the World Series of Poker (WSOP) and the World Poker Tour (WPT). Players who finish in the top two percent of any of these tournaments will win a ticket to one of these events.</p>
<p>So far, the Diamondbacks’ partnership with 888poker has been a success. In fact, the team is currently in first place in its division and is headed for the playoffs.</p>
<p>Whether you’re a fan of the Diamondbacks or not, this is an exciting time to be playing online poker. You never know when you might hit it big and win a trip to one of the world’s most prestigious poker tournaments.</p>
