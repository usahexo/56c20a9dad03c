                <h1>What led Tampa Bay Rays to OK368</h1>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="What-led-Tampa-Bay-Rays-to-OK368"><a href="#What-led-Tampa-Bay-Rays-to-OK368" class="headerlink" title="What led Tampa Bay Rays to OK368?"></a>What led Tampa Bay Rays to OK368?</h1><p>In the offseason of 2018-2019, Tampa Bay Rays made a few big moves. They were able to sign Charlie Morton and Avisail Garcia, as well as trading for Jesus Sucre. However, their most interesting move was when they inked OK368 to a minor league deal. This move has puzzled many baseball analysts and fans, as OK368 is a 33-year-old outfielder who has never played in the major leagues.</p>
<p>So what led Tampa Bay Rays to OK368?</p>
<p>There are a few reasons that could explain why the Rays signed OK368. First, they may be looking for some outfield depth. The outfield is currently manned by Tommy Pham, Kevin Kiermaier, and Austin Meadows. However, Pham is a free agent after this season, and Kiermaier and Meadows have both been injured this year.</p>
<p>Second, the Rays may be trying to develop OK368 into a major league player. Tampa Bay has been known for developing players in their farm system and then bringing them up to the majors. Some examples include Kiermaier, Chris Archer, and Blake Snell.</p>
<p>OK368 has reportedly been working on his hitting mechanics with Rays hitting coach Chad Mottola. This could be another reason that the Rays signed him. He may not be ready to play in the majors right now, but they could be hoping to develop him into a player who can help them in the future.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason for signing OK368, only time will tell if it was a good decision or not. He will likely start off in AAA ball, but he could get called up to the majors later in the season if he continues to improve his batting skills.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-some-of-Eliot’s-notable-achievements-with-the-Rays"><a href="#What-are-some-of-Eliot’s-notable-achievements-with-the-Rays" class="headerlink" title="What are some of Eliot’s notable achievements with the Rays?"></a>What are some of Eliot’s notable achievements with the Rays?</h1><p>Eliot’s achievements with the Rays are notable. Some of his most notable achievements include being a part of the team that went to the World Series in 2008 and making the playoffs in 2011. He was also an All-Star in both 2009 and 2010.</p>
<h1 id="How-does-Eliot-feel-about-his-team’s-performance-this-season"><a href="#How-does-Eliot-feel-about-his-team’s-performance-this-season" class="headerlink" title="How does Eliot feel about his team’s performance this season?"></a>How does Eliot feel about his team’s performance this season?</h1><p>Eliot seems relatively content with the team’s performance this season. In an interview with the local paper, Eliot stated that he was happy with the effort the boys had put in and was optimistic about their future prospects. While the team has not yet achieved all of its goals, Eliot believes that they are headed in the right direction.</p>
<p>Eliot’s confidence in his team is admirable; however, it may be a little premature to call the season a success. The team is currently ranked third in their division, and while they have put up a good fight, they have yet to win any of their games against the top two teams.</p>
<p>If Eliot’s team can manage to pull off some victories against their top competitors, then there is no doubt that they will be able to consider the season a success. In order for this to happen, however, the boys will need to continue playing with heart and determination.</p>
<h1 id="What-changes-might-Eliot-consider-making-to-the-team-in-the-off-season"><a href="#What-changes-might-Eliot-consider-making-to-the-team-in-the-off-season" class="headerlink" title="What changes might Eliot consider making to the team in the off-season?"></a>What changes might Eliot consider making to the team in the off-season?</h1><p>Boston Celtics head coach, Brad Stevens, is faced with some decisions to make in the off-season. The most glaring decision is what to do about the team’s roster. There are a few players who are set in stone, such as Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward. But there are also a few players who are question marks. Much of this will hinge on the decisions of Al Horford and Terry Rozier.</p>
<p>Horford has a player option for next season worth $30 million. He is sure to opt out and explore his options on the open market. The Celtics will likely offer him a contract, but it may not be for the maximum amount he could get elsewhere. Horford seems content in Boston and may be willing to take less money to stay with the team that has made it to two consecutive NBA Finals.</p>
<p>Rozier is a restricted free agent this summer. He will likely be offered a contract by the Celtics, but another team could swoop in and try to sign him to an offer sheet. Rozier has become very important to the Celtics over the last two seasons and they will do everything they can to keep him. It may come down to how much money Rozier wants and whether he is willing to take less than what he could potentially make on the open market.</p>
<p>Assuming Horford and Rozier both re-sign with Boston, there are still some changes that head coach Brad Stevens might consider making to the team. One possibility is that Jayson Tatum moves into a starting role at small forward. This would allow Hayward to move back to his natural position of shooting guard. Hayward was injured early last season and Tatum filled in admirably as a starter. He proved himself as one of the best young players in the league and would be ready for an increased role next season.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that Aron Baynes moves into a starting role at center instead of Al Horford. Baynes had a very good season last year and could easily hold down the fort at center while Horford plays more power forward. This would give the Celtics even more depth at frontcourt positions and allow them more flexibility when matching up against teams with bigger centers.</p>
<p>No matter what changes Stevens decides to make, one thing is for sure: he has an embarrassment of riches when it comes to talent on his roster. The Celtics are one of the few teams in the league that can compete against anyone regardless of who is or isn’t playing. With another year of experience under their belts, look for Boston to be even tougher competition in 2019-2020</p>
<h1 id="What-do-fans-think-of-Eliot-and-the-job-he’s-done-as-manager-of-the-Rays"><a href="#What-do-fans-think-of-Eliot-and-the-job-he’s-done-as-manager-of-the-Rays" class="headerlink" title="What do fans think of Eliot and the job he’s done as manager of the Rays?"></a>What do fans think of Eliot and the job he’s done as manager of the Rays?</h1><p>When Eliot was hired as the new manager of the Rays, there was a lot of speculation about what he would bring to the team. Many fans were unsure about how he would fare in his new role.</p>
<p>Now that Eliot has been manager for a little over a year, what do fans think of him and the job he’s done? Overall, many people seem to be happy with the changes he’s made and believe that he is doing a good job.</p>
<p>One fan said, “I really like the direction Eliot is taking the team. He’s made some great changes and I think we have a lot of potential this season.” Another fan said, “Eliot has done a fantastic job so far. He’s brought a new energy to the team and I’m excited to see what he can do in the future.”</p>
<p>There are always going to be some fans who are unhappy with any change, but it seems that most Rays fans are behind Eliot and believe that he is the right man for the job.</p>
