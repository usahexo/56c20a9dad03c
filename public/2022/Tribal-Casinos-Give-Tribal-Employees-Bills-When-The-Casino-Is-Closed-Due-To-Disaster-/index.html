<p>In the wake of a disaster, tribal casinos are often among the first in line to reopen – giving critical support to local economies and employees. But what happens when the casino is forced to close?</p>
<p>According to a recent report, many tribal casinos have a policy of issuing bills to employees who are not able to work during a closure. This can include those who are unable to make it in due to weather conditions or those who are taking care of loved ones in the aftermath of a disaster.</p>
<p>While some employees find this policy helpful, others feel that it places an undue burden on them during a difficult time. Some have even called for casinos to rescind the bill policies during major emergencies.</p>
<p>What do you think? Is it fair for casinos to issue bills during a closure? Or should they be offering more support to employees during a difficult time?</p>
<h1 id="Tribal-Casinos-Close-Doors-To-Employees-During-Disaster"><a href="#Tribal-Casinos-Close-Doors-To-Employees-During-Disaster" class="headerlink" title="Tribal Casinos Close Doors To Employees During Disaster"></a>Tribal Casinos Close Doors To Employees During Disaster</h1><p>In the wake of Hurricane Florence, some tribal casinos have closed their doors to employees, refusing to let them work. </p>
<p>Lower Swatara Twp. – The Lucky Leo’s Casino in Middletown is among the businesses that have closed its doors to employees during the aftermath of Hurricane Florence. According to management, the decision was made because they were worried about the safety of their employees.</p>
<p>“The health and safety of our team members is always our top priority,” said casino spokesperson Kristen Bower. </p>
<p>While many criticized the casino for its decision, others sided with the business, saying that it was a smart move. </p>
<p>“I don’t think it was unfair at all,” said local resident Barry Koons. “You have to do what you have to do to keep your people safe.” </p>
<p>Despite the closure, the casino remains open to customers.</p>
<h1 id="Tribal-Casino-Workers-Left-Unpaid-After-Closing-For-Disaster"><a href="#Tribal-Casino-Workers-Left-Unpaid-After-Closing-For-Disaster" class="headerlink" title="Tribal Casino Workers Left Unpaid After Closing For Disaster"></a>Tribal Casino Workers Left Unpaid After Closing For Disaster</h1><p>Native American casino workers in Oklahoma are still waiting for paychecks after the casino closed due to a tornado.</p>
<p>The Muscogee (Creek) Nation Casino in Tulsa abruptly closed on March 19 following a tornado that struck the area. The casino staff is now left unpaid and waiting for answers.</p>
<p>One worker, who asked not to be identified, said they were told by management that the closure was “due to unforeseen circumstances.” The worker added that they and their co-workers are owed two weeks of pay.</p>
<p>“People have families,” the worker said. “We need our money.”</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the tribe said they are aware of the situation and are working to resolve it as soon as possible. No timelines were given for when workers might be paid.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that employees of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation Casino have gone unpaid. In January 2018, the casino stopped paying its workers due to a financial shortfall. At that time, employees went several weeks without paychecks.</p>
<p>The tribe told Tulsa World at the time that they were working to resolve the issue and would repay employees as soon as possible. It is unclear if those employees ever received their backpay.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Workers-Given-Bills-Upon-Closing-Doors-In-Disasters"><a href="#Casino-Workers-Given-Bills-Upon-Closing-Doors-In-Disasters" class="headerlink" title="Casino Workers Given Bills Upon Closing Doors In Disasters"></a>Casino Workers Given Bills Upon Closing Doors In Disasters</h1><p>Casino workers in Las Vegas and around the world have been given bills upon closing doors in disasters. The purpose of this is to speed up the process of getting employees out of the building and to their safety. </p>
<p>In 2004, a casino worker union in Las Vegas came up with the idea of giving employees bills as they left the building in case of an emergency. The bill denominations are $100, $50, and $20. This allows employees to leave quickly without having to search for their wallets or money. </p>
<p>Since 2004, other casinos around the world have adopted this policy. For example, the Venetian Macao gave its employees $100 bills when a fire broke out in one of its buildings. And in 2017, when a devastating fire struck The Address Downtown Dubai hotel, staff were given $1,000 bills by management. </p>
<p>The policy has been credited with helping to save lives during emergencies. In particular, it is seen as being helpful during fires when there is smoke and confusion. As one casino worker put it: “It’s very important because, especially in a fire, people are panicked and they don’t know what’s going on.” </p>
<p>There have been some criticisms of this policy, however. Some people argue that it creates an incentive for employees to leave quickly instead of helping others or staying until they are ordered to leave. Others say that it could lead to theft if employees take the money and run. </p>
<p>Despite these criticisms, the majority of casino workers seem to support the bill-upon-closing-doors policy. And it seems likely that it will continue to be used by casinos around the world in order to ensure the safety of their employees during emergencies.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Employees-Struggle-After-Being-Billed-For-Closure-During-A-Disaster"><a href="#Casino-Employees-Struggle-After-Being-Billed-For-Closure-During-A-Disaster" class="headerlink" title="Casino Employees Struggle After Being Billed For Closure During A Disaster"></a>Casino Employees Struggle After Being Billed For Closure During A Disaster</h1><p>Casino employees were not pleased after they received a bill for the closure of the business during a recent disaster. The casino was forced to close down after a natural disaster made it impossible for people to get to the property.</p>
<p>Employees were billed for the days that the casino was closed, and many felt like they were being taken advantage of. Some employees were even told that they would be fired if they did not pay the bill.</p>
<p>Many employees are struggling to make ends meet after being billed for the closure of the casino. Some have even had to take out loans in order to pay the bill.Others have started looking for new jobs, but finding one that pays as well as their old job is proving to be difficult.</p>
<p>The casino has issued an apology to its employees, but many feel like it is not enough. Employees are angry and frustrated, and many feel like they have been wronged.</p>
