#  Why does the pardoner preach towards gambling and drinking? 

The pardoner preaches towards gambling and drinking because he believes that these activities are sinful and lead to damnation. He wants to scare people into avoiding these activities, and he believes that the best way to do this is by preaching about the punishments that await those who engage in them.

#  Pardoner urges against gambling and drinking 

In his prologue to the Canterbury Tales, Geoffrey Chaucer’s Pardoner urges his listeners against two activities that were popular in his day: gambling and drinking. He argues that both are sinful and lead to poverty and other evils.

Gambling, in Chaucer’s time, was seen as a pursuit of the idle rich. Those who gambled often lost large sums of money, leading to bankruptcy or even prison. The Pardoner points out that gamblers are not only wasting their own money, but also innocent people’s money. He observes that “the glad life [of a gambler] is all for nought; for he loses good and wins naught.”

Drinking, meanwhile, can lead to violence, adultery, and other crimes. The Pardoner notes that alcohol makes people do things they would never do sober, including killing their own friends. He compares the effects of alcohol to those of the devil, who also “makes a man drink so much/ That he forgets his own nature.”

Both gambling and drinking can be addictive, leading people to ruin their lives in pursuit of short-term pleasure. The Pardoner therefore urges his listeners to avoid these activities altogether, for their own sake and for the sake of those around them.

#  The pardoner's warnings against gambling and drinking 

The Pardoner begins his sermon by warning the congregation against gambling and drinking. He tells a story of three friends who, out of greed, gambled away their inheritance and ended up dying of thirst in the desert. The Pardoner points to this story as an example of the dangers of gambling and drinking. He urges the congregation not to make the same mistake and to instead use their money for more productive purposes.

#  Why the pardoner preaches against gambling and drinking 

The pardoner spends a good deal of time in his sermon denouncing gambling and drinking. Why does he feel so strongly about these activities?

Gambling can lead to financial ruin. The pardoner has himself been ruined by gambling, and he doesn't want others to suffer the same fate.

Drinking can lead to violence and other criminal activity. The pardoner has seen the effects of alcohol on people firsthand, and he doesn't want others to end up in jail or dead because of it.

#  The pardoner on why gambling and drinking are bad

Gambling and drinking are bad for many reasons. First, they can lead to addiction. Second, they can lead to financial ruin. Third, they can lead to health problems. Finally, they can lead to criminal activity.

Gambling can be addictive because it releases dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is a chemical that makes us feel good. When we gamble, we may get a rush of dopamine that makes us want to gamble more and more. This can lead to gambling addiction.

 Financial ruin can also be a problem with gambling and drinking. Gambling can lead to loss of money and even bankruptcy. Drinking can lead to expensive health problems and even DUIs.

Health problems are another issue with gambling and drinking. Gambling can lead to stress and anxiety. Drinkers may suffer from liver damage, heart disease, and other health problems.

Finally, criminal activity is a danger with gambling and drinking. Gambling can lead to theft, fraud, and other crimes. Drinking can lead to violence and other criminal activity
