#  888 Casino Finally Pays Out Goehte's Winnings After Months of Waiting

It's been a long time coming, but 888 Casino has finally paid out the winnings of German lottery winner Goehte. The online casino had been withholding the €1.5 million prize since May, but caved in to public pressure and paid the money out this week.

Goehte hit the jackpot in March with a €6 bet on a German lotto game. 888 Casino initially said it would take up to two weeks to process the payment, but then months passed without any news. Goehte's lawyers even threatened legal action, but it was only this week that 888 Casino coughed up the cash.

The debacle is another black mark against 888 Casino, which has been embroiled in a number of scandals in recent months. In April, the company was fined £7.8 million by British gaming regulators for failing to protect vulnerable customers. And late last year, an investigation by BBC Panorama revealed that 888 Casino had allowed gambling addicts to lose millions of pounds.

888 Casino has apologized for its failure to pay out Goehte's winnings on time and says it will ensure that such delays don't happen again in future. But for many people, this latest fiasco will have done little to revive confidence in one of the biggest names in online gambling.

#  How long does it take 888 Casino to payout Goehte's winnings?

We all know the story of the German Mathematician Goethe and his lucky 888 Casino payout. The question on everyone's mind is how long did it take 888 Casino to payout Goehte's winnings?

The answer is not as straightforward as one might think. There are a few things to consider when trying to answer this question. For starters, we don't know how much money Goethe won. We also don't know how long it took 888 Casino to process the payout. Finally, we don't know what kind of payment method Goethe used.

Assuming that Goethe won a significant amount of money, it's safe to say that 888 Casino would take some time to process the payout. In general, online casinos take anywhere from 24 hours to a week to process payouts. So it's reasonable to assume that it took at least a week for 888 Casino to payout Goethe's winnings.

However, if Goethe used a payment method like PayPal, his winnings would likely be processed more quickly. PayPal transactions are typically processed within minutes or hours. So if Goethe used PayPal, it's likely that his winnings were paid out within a day or two of him winning them.

#  Why did 888 Casino take so long to payout Goehte's winnings?

In late January, a German man by the name of Goehte won almost €1.5 million (£1.3 million) on a single spin at an online casino. But as of mid-February, he still hasn't been paid. So what's the hold-up?

888 Casino is one of the most reputable and well-known online casinos in the world. So it came as quite a shock when they took so long to payout Goehte's winnings. Theories abound as to why they're taking so long, but no one seems to have a definitive answer.

Some say that 888 Casino is intentionally dragging their feet in order to make Goehte's winnings look smaller in comparison to later payouts. Others believe that there may be some sort of issue with his withdrawal request. And still others think that 888 Casino is simply trying to avoid paying out such a large sum of money.

Whatever the reason may be, it's causing a lot of frustration among players who have won big jackpots at 888 Casino. Many feel that the company is taking advantage of its customers and isn't living up to its reputation for good customer service.

It will be interesting to see how this situation plays out and whether 888 Casino finally pays out Goehte's winnings in full. In the meantime, players are advised to take caution before wagering any large sums at this casino.

#  888 Casino finally pays out after public outcry

888 Casino is a household name among online casino gamers. The site has been in business since 1997 and has built up a large and loyal following.

However, in recent months the site has been making headlines for all the wrong reasons. Gamblers have been protesting on social media that they have not been paid out their winnings, with some citing amounts in the tens of thousands of pounds.

Many people were sceptical about the legitimacy of the complaints, thinking that players were simply trying to scam 888 Casino out of their money. However, it soon came to light that there was a genuine issue with payouts at 888 Casino, as players were not receiving the money they had won.

This caused a public outcry, with many people calling for 888 Casino to honour their commitments to players. Finally, after much pressure from the public and from regulatory bodies, 888 Casino has announced that it will be paying out all of the outstanding winnings.

This is great news for gamblers who have had their hard-earned money tied up in limbo for months. Hopefully this debacle will serve as a lesson to 888 Casino and other online casinos – when you make a commitment to your customers, you need to honour it.

#  How many months did it take 888 Casino to payout Goehte's winnings?

The German gambler Goethe won €2.9 million (£2.5 million) in March 2017 from playing at 888 Casino, but the online casino only paid out the winnings in January 2018, after taking eight months to process the paperwork.

888 Casino is one of the largest and most popular online casinos in the world, but its slow payout times have come under fire in recent years. In January 2016, it took the casino more than six months to pay out a £1.3 million jackpot win.

In response to criticism, 888 Casino has said that it takes its responsibility to ensure that players are legitimate very seriously, and that all payouts are subject to rigorous checks before being released. The casino has also said that it has processes in place to ensure that players do not experience long payout delays.
