#  What are the odds of winning in the Fruit Million St. Patricks Edition game?

There is no one definitive answer to this question. However, there are some things that you can consider in order to arrive at a reasonably accurate estimate.

The first thing that you need to determine is the probability of each possible outcome. This can be done by consulting the game's rules, as well as by doing some basic math. In the Fruit Million St. Patricks Edition game, there are three different ways to win:

- Winning a prize by matching two out of three symbols on the ticket

- Winning a prize by matching three out of four symbols on the ticket

- Winning a prize by matching four out of four symbols on the ticket

For the purposes of this article, we will assume that you are only interested in estimating the odds of winning the top prize. So, we will focus on calculating the probability of winning by matching three out of four symbols on the ticket. This is because it is currently the top prize offered in the game.

According to the game's rules, there are 16 possible outcomes for this particular bet. There are 14 different types of fruit symbols and two different blank symbols. Therefore, there is a 1 in 16 chance of winning any given bet by matching three out of four symbols on your ticket.

Now that you know how likely it is to win a particular prize, you need to calculate how often each type of prize is awarded. Again, this information can be found in the game's rules. In this particular game, there are a total of 122 prizes available across all denominations. However, not all prizes are awarded every time that someone plays the game. In fact, most prizes are only awarded once every few thousand games or so.

Given this information, we can estimate that there is only a 1 in 4000 chance of winning any given prize when playing Fruit Million St. Patricks Edition. This means that if you played 1000 games, you would only win a prize once or twice on average. Prize odds change depending on what denomination you're playing for though - so make sure to consult the game's rules for more detailed information about your specific odds.
