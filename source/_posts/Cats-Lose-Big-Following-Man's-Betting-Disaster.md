#  Man's Gambling Loss Costs Him His Home and Car

According to a recent study, one in three Americans have gambled in the past year. Gambling can be an enjoyable and entertaining hobby for some, but for others it can quickly spiral out of control.

The man had been gambling since he was a teenager, but things took a turn for the worse when he began borrowing money from friends and family to finance his habit. His debt grew so large that he could no longer afford to pay his mortgage or car payments. In desperation, he turned to online gambling in order to try and win back some of his money. Unfortunately, this only made things worse and he eventually lost his home and car.

#  Cats Game Ends in Disaster for One Man's Bank Account

It's a scene that's been played out in basements, garages and living rooms for decades: a group of friends get together to play some tabletop games. But for one unlucky man, the consequences of this particular game night were anything but fun.

The night started off innocently enough, with the group of friends settling in around the table for a few rounds of Catan. But as the game went on, things started to go downhill fast. Not only was the man losing badly, but he was also running low on cash. And when it came time to pay up, he didn't have enough to cover his losses.

His friends weren't too happy about it, and they made sure he knew it. One even went so far as to say that the man "should have known better than to bring his cat game to our house." Ouch.

Needless to say, the rest of the evening was pretty uncomfortable for everyone involved. The man went home with a bruised ego and an empty bank account, while his friends were left picking up the pieces of what had once been a fun game night.

So if you're ever invited to play Catan – or any other tabletop game – be sure to bring plenty of cash. You never know when you might need it!
