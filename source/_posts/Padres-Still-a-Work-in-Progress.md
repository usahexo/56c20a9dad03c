#  Padres Still a Work in Progress

The Padres were a team that many thought would surprise in the National League West this season. They finished last season strong and acquired some key players over the winter. Despite a slow start, they still remain in the hunt for a playoff spot.

Their pitching staff has been good but not great. The offense has been led by Hunter Renfroe and Manuel Margot. Franchy Cordero has also played well since being called up from Triple-A. Wil Myers has been disappointing, as have other hitters such as Eric Hosmer and Freddy Galvis.

The bullpen has also been inconsistent. Kirby Yates has been one of their best relievers, while Brad Hand and Craig Stammen have struggled at times.

Overall, the Padres are still a work in progress. They could make the playoffs if they play well down the stretch, but they could also miss out if they don't improve soon.

#  Padres Hope to Bounce Back in 2018

The Padres had a rough 2017, finishing in last place in the National League West with a record of 71-91. They hope to rebound in 2018 with a new manager, Andy Green, and some new players.

First baseman Eric Hosmer was the biggest acquisition of the offseason, signing a eight-year, $144 million contract. Hosmer is coming off a career year with the Royals, where he hit .318 with 25 homers and 94 RBIs. Other new additions include third baseman Chase Headley, outfielder Wil Myers, and starting pitcher Bryan Mitchell.

The Padres will be relying on their young players to improve in 2018. Rookie shortstop Freddy Galvis had a good 2017, hitting .256 with 12 homers and 61 RBIs. Center fielder Manuel Margot also showed promise, hitting .268 with 10 homers and 29 RBIs in only 87 games. Pitchers Luis Perdomo and Dinelson Lamet also have potential and should improve in their sophomore seasons.

Overall, the Padres have a lot of talent and should be better than they were last year. They will need to play well to compete in a tough NL West division that includes the Dodgers, Giants, and Rockies.

#  A Win and a Loss on Opening Day

The Detroit Tigers had high hopes for their 2018 season. They kicked off the year with a three-game series against the Miami Marlins at Marlins Park. The first game of the series didn't go as planned, as the Tigers lost 4-2. However, they were able to bounce back in the second game and win 5-3. Unfortunately, they were not able to close out the series in the third game, losing 8-6.

The Tigers' biggest contributors over the course of the series were Miguel Cabrera and Jeimer Candelario. In game one, Cabrera went 2-4 with an RBI and a run scored. In game two, Cabrera went 1-4 with an RBI and two runs scored. Candelario also shined in game two, going 3-4 with an RBI and two runs scored.

While it is disappointing that the Tigers lost game three, this series provides some optimism for their future success. Offensively, Cabrera and Candelario looked great and they will most likely continue to produce at a high level. Additionally, pitcher Michael Fulmer looked solid in his first start of the season despite taking the loss. Overall, there are many positives that can be taken away from this series for Detroit fans.

#  Padres Look to Start Strong in Second Half

The San Diego Padres have had an up-and-down season so far, but they are looking to start the second half strong. They will have their work cut out for them, as they are scheduled to play some tough teams in the coming weeks.

The Padres will start the second half with a series against the Colorado Rockies. The Rockies are one of the top teams in the National League, so the Padres will need to play well if they want to win.

After their series against the Rockies, the Padres will travel to Los Angeles to take on the Dodgers. The Dodgers are also one of the top teams in the NL, and they will be a tough opponent for San Diego.

If the Padres can manage to win at least one of these series, it will be a good start to the second half. They will then travel to Cincinnati to take on the Reds. The Reds are not as good as either the Rockies or Dodgers, but they still pose a threat to San Diego.

If the Padres can win all three of these series, it would be an excellent way to start the second half. However, realistically speaking, it is unlikely that they will sweep all three series. Even so, if they can at least come out with a winning record, that would be a great accomplishment.

#  Padres Finish the Season Strong

The Padres have been playing very well as of late. In their last series against the Giants, they managed to win two out of the three games. This strong performance was very much needed, as they had been struggling mightily in previous series.

One of the factors that has led to their recent success is the play of their young players. Manuel Margot, Hunter Renfroe and Freddy Galvis have all been putting up big numbers lately. Margot has been especially impressive, as he has been one of the team's top hitters all season long.

The Padres will need continue to play well in order to end the season on a high note. If they can manage to win a few more series, they could potentially make it into the playoffs. This would be a major accomplishment for a team that was expected to finish near the bottom of the standings.

If they do manage to make it into the playoffs, they will likely be facing an uphill battle. However, anything is possible in baseball, and they could certainly surprise some teams if they get hot at the right time.

Overall, things are looking bright for the Padres moving forward. They have a lot of young talent on their roster, and they should only improve in future seasons. Fans should be excited about the prospects for this team, and should definitely keep an eye on them in 2018 and beyond.
