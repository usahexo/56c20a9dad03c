#  Diamondbacks players hit the virtual felt to play poker with good friends

Arizona Diamondbacks players hit the virtual felt on Monday night, playing poker with some of their good friends.

"It was a lot of fun," said Diamondbacks infielder Daniel Descalso. "We all get along really well and it's just a good time to get together and play some poker."

The group of players included starters Paul Goldschmidt and Zack Greinke, as well as reliever Archie Bradley and other veterans like Descalso.

"I think we all kind of know each others' tendencies at the table," said Bradley. "It makes for a little more fun when you can have some banter back and forth."

It wasn't all laughs and good times, though, as the Diamondbacks team fought for a spot in this year's World Series. Poker games provided a way for the players to stay close-knit, focus on their goals, and take a break from the game.

"I think it's important, especially in this day and age where everything is so high-pressure," said Goldschmidt. "You can get caught up in that pretty easily if you're not careful. It's nice to have something else to focus on."

#  How Arizona Diamondbacks players use online poker to connect with good friends

Professional athletes often have to find ways to connect with their friends during the offseason. While some people may golf or travel, Arizona Diamondbacks players often use online poker to connect and bond with friends.

“I’ve been playing online poker for years and it’s always been a great way to connect with friends,” says Diamondbacks pitcher Clay Buchholz. “There are a lot of guys in the locker room who play, so it’s a great way to spend time together when we’re not all together physically.”

Poker can be a social activity that connects friends in ways other activities might not.

“I think poker is great for building relationships because it forces people to communicate and work together,” says Diamondbacks infielder Daniel Descalso. “You have to make quick decisions and read other people if you want to win, so it really tests your ability to read someone and work with them. That can translate into real life pretty easily.”

In addition to being a fun way for players to connect with friends, online poker can also be helpful in maintaining skillsets needed for the game. Some D-Backs players even use the games as a way to prepare for the season.

“I use online poker as a way to sharpen my skills for the season,” admits Buchholz. “It can be tough to stay sharp during the offseason, but playing online helps me keep my mind in game mode and I think that helps me when I do have to start pitching again.”

For some players, online poker is just a fun activity they enjoy during their free time. But for others, it is a tool they use to stay sharp and connected with friends – both on and off the field.
