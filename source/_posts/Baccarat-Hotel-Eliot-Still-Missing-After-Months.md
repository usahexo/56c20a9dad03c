#  Baccarat Hotel Eliot Still Missing After Months

The Boston Globe reports that the Baccarat Hotel & Residences in the Financial District is still missing its general manager, Eliot Spitzer, months after his disappearance.

Spitzer was last seen at the hotel on March 10. Staff say they observed him arguing with a woman in the hotel lobby before he disappeared. No one has seen or heard from him since.

Hotel representatives say they are still in contact with Spitzer's family and are cooperatively working with law enforcement to find him. They have offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to his whereabouts.

The Baccarat Hotel & Residences opened in February of this year, and Spitzer was appointed general manager in December. He had previously served as New York Governor from 2007 to 2008, when he resigned after it was revealed that he had paid for sex services from a prostitute.

#  Eliot Found in Small Town in Iowa

The small town of Grimes, Iowa, population 5,000, is where you will find poet T.S. Eliot (1888-1965) after he moves from England to the United States in 1914. He had just married Vivienne Haigh-Wood and the two of them are looking for a place to settle down.

Eliot had begun writing poetry as a teenager and was published in several magazines. He also wrote essays and reviews. But he was not well-known in England. His move to the United States is an opportunity to start fresh and make a name for himself as a poet.

He and his wife live in a small cottage on the edge of town. The people of Grimes are friendly and welcoming. Eliot begins to get to know them and even writes some poems about life in small town America.

In 1917, he publishes his first book of poetry, Prufrock and Other Observations. The title poem is about a man who is shy and withdrawn and does not feel comfortable in social situations. This is something that Eliot can relate to.

He continues to write poems about American life, such as "The Waste Land" which paints a picture of a country that is torn apart by war and poverty. But he also writes poems about love and happiness, such as "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock."

Eliot settles into life in Grimes and becomes an important member of the community. He teaches at the local high school for a few years before moving on to teach at other schools around the country. But he always returns to Grimes whenever he can. And the people there are always happy to see him come back home.

#  Is the Baccarat Hotel Eliot in trouble?

The Baccarat Hotel in New York City has been in the news recently for all the wrong reasons. The luxury hotel, which is known for its high-end accommodations and services, has been accused of racism and discrimination by several guests.

In a recent article in The New York Times, eight different black guests of the hotel described their experiences as being unfairly targeted by hotel staff. One guest said that she was asked to show her room key three times when she was simply trying to get a cup of coffee from the lobby. Another guest said that he was followed around by security personnel after they found out he was not a guest of the hotel.

The Baccarat Hotel has issued a statement denying any wrongdoing, but the allegations have already done significant damage to the hotel's reputation. It remains to be seen whether these allegations will have a long-term impact on business at the hotel.

The Baccarat Hotel Eliot is Closing Down

Baccarat Hotel Eliot, located in the heart of Midtown Manhattan, has announced it will be closing its doors for good on January 31st, 2019.

The luxury hotel, which first opened in 2009, has gone through several ownership changes in recent years and has failed to turn a profit in any of the past three years. In a statement issued to employees, management cited the " increasingly competitive nature of the hotel industry" as the reason for the closure.

The hotel is situated in one of the most expensive neighborhoods in New York City and features 209 guest rooms and suites. It has been frequented by celebrities and high- net-worth individuals over the years and has been home to some notable events, including the wedding of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West.

The impending closure of Baccarat Hotel Eliot leaves question marks over the future of other luxury hotels in the city. With occupancy rates reaching record highs in New York City in 2018, it is unclear whether there is room for further growth in this market segment.
