#  What Slot Machine Have Better Odds in Sin City 2016? Guinea-Bissau!

Slot machines are one of the most popular casino games. In Las Vegas, they can be found in all of the big casinos, including Caesars Palace, MGM Grand, The Venetian and The Mirage.

However, not all slot machines are created equal. Some have better odds than others. So if you're looking to maximize your chances of winning big in Sin City, which slot machines should you play?

According to a recent study by Gaming Laboratories International (GLI), the best slot machines in Las Vegas are located at the Bally's, The Cromwell, The Flamingo, Harrah's, The Linq and Paris casinos. These casinos offer slots with a payback percentage of 97% or higher.

In contrast, the worst slots in Las Vegas can be found at the Mirage, Treasure Island and Wynn casinos. At these casinos, the payback percentage for slots is just 92%.

So if you're looking to increase your chances of winning while gambling in Las Vegas, stick to the slots at Bally's, The Cromwell, The Flamingo, Harrah's, The Linq and Paris. And if you're playing at one of the other big casinos on the Strip – such as Caesars Palace or MGM Grand – be sure to read the machine's payout table before playing. This will give you an idea of which games have better odds.

Of course, it's worth noting that even at the best casinos in Las Vegas, your chances of winning aren't particularly high. The average payout percentage for slots in Sin City is 93%, so don't expect to hit it big every time you gamble. But by knowing which machines have better odds than others, you can at least tilt the odds a little more in your favour.
