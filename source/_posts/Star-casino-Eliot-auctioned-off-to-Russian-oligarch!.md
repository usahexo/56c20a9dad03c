#  Star casino Eliot auctioned off to Russian oligarch!

The Star casino in Sydney was sold last week to a Russian oligarch after a fierce bidding war with two other global super-rich investors.

Eliot Gaming, the company that owns the casino, put it up for sale in late March and received offers from two billionaires â€“ one from China and another from Russia. But it was Russian oligarch, Dimitry Rybolovlev, who won out with a $US1.2 billion bid.

The Star casino is one of Australia's most iconic tourist destinations and is a major employer in the Sydney area. It has been under private ownership since it was built by James Packer in 1999.

Rybolovlev is the owner of Monaco football club and is listed as the 156th richest person in the world, with a net worth of $US9.5 billion. He made his fortune in the fertilizer industry and has been buying up luxury assets around the world in recent years.

Some industry insiders are worried that he may be more interested in stripping the casino of its assets than running it as a successful business. Rybolovlev has not yet commented on his plans for The Star casino.

#  Eliot Spitzer sells star casino at fire-sale price!

Former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer has agreed to sell his stake in the Star Casino in Las Vegas for just $1, the Associated Press reported.

The $1 price tag is a fire-sale price, as the casino is currently worth an estimated $825 million. As part of the sale agreement, Spitzer will also step down from his role as chairman and CEO of the casino.

The move comes as Spitzer faces mounting legal troubles; he was recently charged with promoting prostitution.

Spitzer's $1 offer amounts to a 99 percent discount on the casino's market value. Analysts say that the low price reflects the casino's struggles in recent months; revenue at the casino has fallen significantly since last year.

The deal is expected to close within days.

#  Who will get their hands on star casino Eliot?

The Star casino is one of the most highly sought-after venues in the country. As a result, there is always a lot of speculation about who will get their hands on it. Recently, there has been a lot of talk about the possibility of the Star casino being sold to billionaire businessman, Eliot Spitzer.

Spitzer is no stranger to the casino industry. In fact, he was once the Governor of New York and was responsible for legalizing gambling in that state. If he were to purchase the Star casino, it would be a major coup for him. Not only would it give him a foothold in the Australian market, but it would also make him one of the biggest players in the Asia-Pacific region.

There is no doubt that Spitzer has the resources to purchase the Star casino. However, whether or not he will actually follow through with the deal remains to be seen. There are some who believe that he is simply using the speculation as a way to drive up the price tag on the property.

Whatever ends up happening, one thing is for sure: The Star casino is definitely heating up!

#   mystery bidder wins star casino Eliot in auction!

Reports out of Australia this morning are stating that a mystery bidder has won the rights to the Star Casino in Sydney. The casino is reported to have been sold for $1.1 billion AUD, more than double what the property was expected to go for.

This comes as a surprise to many in the industry, as the Star Casino has been struggling in recent years. In March of this year, the casino announced it would be shedding nearly 600 jobs as part of a major restructuring plan.

The identity of the mystery bidder has not yet been revealed, and it is unclear what their plans are for the property.

#  Russian billionaire buys star casino Eliot!

A Russian billionaire has bought the star casino Eliot for an undisclosed fee, according to industry sources.

The purchase of the casino, which is one of the most popular in the city, is seen as a sign of increasing investment in the city's gambling industry by Russian investors.

The billionaire, who has not been identified, is said to be keen to modernize the casino and make it one of the leading venues in the city.

The news comes as a boost to the city's struggling gambling industry, which has been hit hard by increased regulation and falling visitor numbers in recent years.

"This is great news for our city," said a spokesperson for the casino. "We are looking forward to working with our new owner to make Eliot the best casino it can be."
