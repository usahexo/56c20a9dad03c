#  Sports Wagering is Coming to the Encore Casino!

The Encore Casino in Everett, Massachusetts is getting a face lift and with that, a new amenity: sports wagering. This week, the casino announced it will open a sportsbook in partnership with the international betting company William Hill. The book is expected to open in time for the NFL season in September.

It will be the only casino in Massachusetts with this option. Gamblers in the state have been able to place bets on horse races since 2011, but this will be the first time they can bet on major sports events.

The William Hill book at the Encore Casino will offer bettors a variety of options, including point spreads, money lines, and totals for NFL, NCAA football, NBA, NCAA basketball, and Major League Baseball games. In addition, there will be a host of prop bets available, such as which team will score first or whether either team will score in the last five minutes of play.

Betting on sports is one of the most popular forms of gambling in the United States. In fact, according to research by Eilers & Krejcik Gaming LLC., more than $152 billion was wagered on sporting events in 2017. That's more than double the amount wagered on state lotteries.

With that much money at stake, it's no wonder casinos are looking to get into the sports betting business. And given that most states don't have any laws prohibiting it, there's plenty of room for growth. It's estimated that as many as half of all Americans gamble on sports at some point during the year.

So far, only six states have legalized sports betting: Nevada, Delaware, New Jersey, West Virginia, Rhode Island and Mississippi. But that number is expected to grow rapidly now that the Supreme Court has struck down PASPA (the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act), which had outlawed sports betting nationwide except in Nevada.

Now that gambling is legal on a state-by-state basis, casinos are scrambling to get their sports books up and running. The market is expected to be worth billions of dollars annually and there's plenty of money to be made by those who get in early.

You can expect to see more and more casinos getting into the sports wagering business over the next few years as they try to tap into this lucrative market. So if you're a fan of gambling—or just like to watch games with a little action—you'll soon have a whole new range of options available to you at your local casino.
