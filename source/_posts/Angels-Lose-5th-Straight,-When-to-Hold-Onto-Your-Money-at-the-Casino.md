#  Angels Lose 5th Straight, When to Hold Onto Your Money at the Casino

The Angels have now lost 5 games in a row and are quickly falling out of contention in the AL West. If you're an Angels fan, it may be time to start thinking about cashing in your chips and calling it a season.

But if you're not quite ready to give up on the Halos just yet, there's still some money to be made at the casino. In particular, there are a few games you should hold onto your cash and avoid playing altogether.

Here are four games to stay away from when visiting the casino:

1. Blackjack - The house edge on blackjack is typically around 1%, so the odds are always against you when playing this game. If you want to make any money betting on blackjack, you need to be able to count cards like a professional gambler.

2. Craps - The house edge on craps is around 11%, making it one of the worst games in the casino. With dice being rolled across the table, there's always plenty of opportunity for Lady Luck to smile on you - or not.

3. Slot Machines - Slot machines have one of the highest house edges in the casino, averaging around 15%. That means that for every $100 you spend on slots, you can expect to lose $15 in the long run.

4. Roulette - Roulette is another game with a high house edge, averaging around 5%. This means that for every $100 you wager at roulette, you can expect to lose $5 in the long run.

#  Trout Goes 0-4, Angels Fall to Padres

The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim had a rough outing against the San Diego Padres on Tuesday night. The team’s best player, Mike Trout, went 0-4 and the Angels lost 5-3.

With the loss, the Angels fall to 55-51 on the season and are now two games back of the Oakland Athletics for first place in the American League West division.

Angels starting pitcher Tyler Skaggs had a rocky night, giving up four runs in six innings pitched. The Padres’ relief pitchers were able to hold down the Angels’ offense for the remainder of the game.

The only bright spot for the Angels on Tuesday was young outfielder Wilmer Font, who made his major league debut and went 1-2 with an RBI.

The Angels will take on the Padres again tonight at 7:10 PM PT in San Diego.

#  Pujols Out with Hamstring Injury, Time to Cash In on Your Betting Odds?

Adrian Beltre and the Los Angeles Angels were dealt a tough blow on Tuesday when it was announced that first baseman Albert Pujols would be out for an extended period of time with a hamstring injury.

The injury occurred on Monday night in Anaheim when Pujols chased down a foul ball in the stands. He immediately grabbed his hamstring and was removed from the game.

An MRI on Tuesday showed that Pujols had suffered a Grade 2 strain, which is expected to sideline him for eight to 12 weeks.

It’s unclear at this point how the Angels will fill the void left by Pujols’ injury, but they are obviously going to be a much different team without their RBI machine in the lineup.

The timing of Pujols’ injury is particularly unfortunate for Los Angeles, as they are currently in a tight battle with the Seattle Mariners for first place in the American League West.

If you had placed a bet on the Angels to win the division before Pujols was injured, your odds would have likely improved significantly since they are now without their star player.

At this point, it’s hard to know exactly how big of an impact Pujols’ injury will have on the rest of the season, but it’s clear that his absence is going to be felt by the Angels.
A lot can change over the next few weeks, but if you think that Los Angeles is going to struggle without Pujols, now might be a good time to cash in your bet.

#  Halos Can't Seem to Catch a Break, Should You Keep Playing Blackjack in LA?

Las Vegas is the place to be for some gambling. You can find all sorts of games, from craps to roulette, and of course blackjack, the king of gambling games. However, there's a new hotspot for blackjack players looking for an edge: Los Angeles.

Players in LA are finding that they can get better deals on blackjack games than they can in Vegas, and the casinos are also more lenient when it comes to basic strategy. That's why some experts are now saying that LA is the place to play blackjack, but only if you're using proper strategy.

If you're not using basic strategy, then you're simply giving the casino an advantage over you. In fact, the house edge in blackjack is usually around 0.5%, which means that for every $100 you gamble, you can expect to lose $0.50 on average.

However, if you're using proper basic strategy, then your odds are much better; in fact, they're about even money. This means that for every $100 you gamble, you'll lose about $50 on average … but you could also win $50 as well. It all depends on the cards that are dealt to you.

So why should you bother learning basic strategy? Well, because it gives you a better chance of winning at blackjack. If you're not using basic strategy, then the casino has an edge over you; but if you are using basic strategy, then the casino has no advantage at all.

#  Anaheim Slips in Latest Standings, Now May be Time to Gamble on Baseball

Anaheim started the season as a hot topic around baseball. Many experts projected them as contenders for the World Series, but now they are starting to slip in the standings.

At this point, it may be time for the team to start gambling on some new players. There are a few interesting players who may be available before the trade deadline, and Anaheim could put themselves back in contention by acquiring them.

Andrew McCutchen from the Pittsburgh Pirates is one example. He is still a very good player, and he could help Anaheim make a playoff run. Another potential target is Chris Archer from the Tampa Bay Rays. He is also having a solid season, and he could give Anaheim an edge over their opponents.

It will be interesting to see what the team does in the coming weeks. If they can make some shrewd moves, then they may still have a chance at making a deep playoff run.
