#  Woman Who Drove Men Crazy in The Mummy Pays Out Big!

It's been a few years since the release of "The Mummy" and its star, an unknown actress by the name of Rachel Weisz, has come into her own. This woman, who drove men crazy in that film, just scored a big payday in her divorce settlement from fellow actor, Daniel Craig.

Weisz and Craig married in 2011 and have a young daughter together. The couple separated earlier this year and word is that things went south pretty quickly after Craig was caught cheating on Weisz with an American actress.

In the end, Weisz walked away with a whopping $15 million payout as well as primary custody of their daughter. That should keep her nice and comfortable for a while!
